# Avery's Portfolio

My name is Avery Burnett. I’m a designer from Ottawa, Canada. I’m a passionate problem solver and love designing for myself and others. My focus is packaging design, branding & identity, UI/UX, illustration and print media. Most of all I make beautiful designs that communicate to every challenge.
